<h1>Link Rides Terms of Service</h1>
<i>Last Updated: July 16, 2020</i>
<p>These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”) between you and Link Rides, its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers and directors (collectively, “Link Rides,” “we,” “us” or “our”) governing your use of the Link Rides application, website, and technology platform (collectively, the “Link Rides Platform”).</p>
<p>By entering into this Agreement, and/or by using or accessing the Link Rides Platform you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement and accept all of its terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE LINK RIDES PLATFORM OR ANY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH THE LINK RIDES PLATFORM.</p>
<h2>The Link Rides Platform</h2>
<p>The Link Rides Platform provides a volunteer service where persons who seek transportation to certain destinations (“Riders”) can be matched with transportation options to such destinations. One option for Riders is to request a ride from rideshare drivers who are driving to or through those destinations (“Drivers”). Drivers and Riders are collectively referred to herein as “Users,” and the driving services provided by Drivers to Riders shall be referred to herein as "Rideshare Services." As a User, you authorize Link Rides to match you with a Driver or Rider based on factors such as your location, the estimated time to pickup, your destination, user preferences, and platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match and rematch based on the same considerations. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Rideshare Services is a decision made in such User’s sole discretion. Each Rideshare Service provided by a Driver to a Rider shall constitute a separate agreement between such persons.</p>
<h2>Modification to the Agreement</h2>
<p>Link Rides reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such modifications shall be binding on you only upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement. Link Rides reserves the right to modify any information on pages referenced in the hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall become effective upon posting.</p>

You may not allow other persons to use your User account, and you agree that you are the sole authorized user of your account. To use the Link Rides Platform, each User shall create a User account. Each person may only create one User account, and Link Rides reserves the right to deactivate any additional or duplicate accounts.</p>
